#&gt; 3                                                                                                                                    The service was meh.
#&gt; 4                                                      We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
#&gt; 5                                                                                                                         I've never been treated so bad.
#&gt; 6                   Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
#&gt; 7     Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
#&gt; 8                                                                                                     "It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."
#&gt; 9                                                                                                          "The service was terrible, food was mediocre."
#&gt; 10                                                                                                                                         Mediocre food.
#&gt; 11                                                                                                 The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
#&gt; 12                                                                                                     I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
#&gt; 13                                                                                                             Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
#&gt; 14                                                                            We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
#&gt; 15                                                                                                             But I definitely would not eat here again.
#&gt; 16                                Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
#&gt; 17                                                                                                            very slow at seating even with reservation.
#&gt; 18                                                                                     "I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food."
#&gt; 19  The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
#&gt; 20                                                                            A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
#&gt; 21                                                                                                                                         Service sucks.
#&gt; 22                                                                                  "It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."
#&gt; 23      I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
#&gt; 24                                                                                                                              Won't ever go here again.
#&gt; 25                 "By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."
#&gt; 26                                                                                                        Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
#&gt; 27                                                                                                                The selection of food was not the best.
#&gt; 28                                                                                                                                       I was mortified.
#&gt; 29                                                                     After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
#&gt; 30                                                                                        "For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."
#&gt; 31                                                                                                   Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
#&gt; 32                                                                                                      Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
#&gt; 33                                                                                                       We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
#&gt; 34                                                                                                              It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
#&gt; 35                                                                                                                                   Terrible management.
#&gt; 36                                                                             "The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all."
#&gt; 37                                                                                               We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
#&gt; 38                                      "Ordered a double cheeseburger &amp; got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks."
#&gt; 39                                          "Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."
#&gt; 40                                                                                            Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
#&gt; 41                                                                                                                             The manager was the worst.
#&gt; 42                                                                                                           first time there and might just be the last.
#&gt; 43   "This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things."
#&gt; 44                                                                       "the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
#&gt; 45                                                         "To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."
#&gt; 46                                                                                                                          But then they came back cold.
#&gt; 47                                                                                          After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
#&gt; 48                                                                                          "REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good."

#&gt; 50                                                                                                    "Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it."
#&gt; 51                                                                                                                              Don't bother coming here.
#&gt; 52                                                                                                                                          dont go here.
#&gt; 53                                                                                                                 Just don't know why they were so slow.
#&gt; 54                                                                                                                    Probably not in a hurry to go back.
#&gt; 55                                           "For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."
#&gt; 56                                                                                 My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
#&gt; 57                                        The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
#&gt; 58                                                                                                                                  Left very frustrated.
#&gt; 59                                                                                                             Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
#&gt; 60                                                                  My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
#&gt; 61                                                             "I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!"
#&gt; 62                                              First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished &amp; just plain yucky!!!
#&gt; 63                                                                                                               "The service was not up to par, either."
#&gt; 64                                                                                          I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
#&gt; 65                                                                                  "It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor."
#&gt; 66                                                                                     I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
#&gt; 67                                                                  "I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
#&gt; 68                                                                                                                               Appetite instantly gone.
#&gt; 69                                                                                     I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
#&gt; 70                                                                                    "It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign."
#&gt; 71                                                                                                                                Food was below average.
#&gt; 72                                                                                                                        I've never been treated so bad.
#&gt; 73                                                                                                 The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
#&gt; 74                                                                                                                                    The Burrittos Blah!
#&gt; 75                                                                                                   "Needless to say, we will never be back here again."
#&gt; 76                                                                                                                                       I'm super pissd.
#&gt; 77                           "No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
#&gt; 78                                                                                                              We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
#&gt; 79                 "The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."
#&gt; 80                                                                                                               I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
#&gt; 81                                                                                                        I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
#&gt; 82                                           "For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon."
#&gt; 83                                                                                                                       The desserts were a bit strange.
#&gt; 84                                                                                                                My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
#&gt; 85                                                                                          I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
#&gt; 86               "Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
#&gt; 87                                                                                                          I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
#&gt; 88                                                                                                                                I give it 2 thumbs down
#&gt; 89                                                                                                              "I'd rather eat airline food, seriously."
#&gt; 90                                            I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
#&gt; 91                                                                                               "It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad."
#&gt; 92                                                                          We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
#&gt; 93                                                                                              this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
#&gt; 94                                                                                                            A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
#&gt; 95                                                                                          She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
#&gt; 96                                                                                                                                    Soggy and not good.
#&gt; 97                                           "I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."
#&gt; 98                    "We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived."
#&gt; 99                                                                                             "The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily."
#&gt; 100                                                                                                                   "Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."

#&gt; 102                            "He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas."

#&gt; 104                                                                                                                         Waited and waited and waited.
#&gt; 105                                                                                                                                       What a mistake.
#&gt; 106                                                                     They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
#&gt; 107                                                               "Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up."

#&gt; 109                                                                                                                            Boy was that sucker dry!!.
#&gt; 110                                                                    "Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!"

#&gt; 112            I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
#&gt; 113                                                                                                                             I was VERY disappointed!!
#&gt; 114                                                                                  "The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork."
#&gt; 115                                                            When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
#&gt; 116                                                                                                                               I give it 2 thumbs down
#&gt; 117                                          "I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."

#&gt; 120                                                                                                   I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
#&gt; 121                                                                                                "Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon."
#&gt; 122                                                                  "The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined."
#&gt; 123                                                                                 My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
#&gt; 124                                                                                            I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
#&gt; 125                                The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
#&gt; 126                                                                                                                                The food was terrible.
#&gt; 127                                         The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
#&gt; 128                                                                                                Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
#&gt; 129                                   We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
#&gt; 130                                                                                                                      RUDE &amp; INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
#&gt; 131                                             It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
#&gt; 132                                                                                                                                It was way over fried.
#&gt; 133                                                                                                                        The service was a bit lacking.
#&gt; 134                                                                               "Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon."
#&gt; 135                                                                                                                                           Over rated.
#&gt; 136                                                                                                                   Probably not in a hurry to go back.
#&gt; 137                                                "Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back."
#&gt; 138  "Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."
#&gt; 139                                                                                                                 I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
#&gt; 140                                              "Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more."
#&gt; 141                                                                                                       Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
#&gt; 142                                                                                                                                        Won't go back.
#&gt; 143                                                                                The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
#&gt; 144                                                                                                                  We won't be going back anytime soon!
#&gt; 145                                                                                                          the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
#&gt; 146                                                                          "However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good."
#&gt; 147                                                                 "I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
#&gt; 148                                                                                                             It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
#&gt; 149                                                                                                                     I will not be eating there again.
#&gt; 150                                                                                                            Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
#&gt; 151                                                                                                                                  Con: spotty service.

#&gt; 153                                                                                                                 I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
#&gt; 154                                                                                                                         This place deserves no stars.
#&gt; 155                                                                                                                                    I was so insulted.
#&gt; 156                                                                             Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
#&gt; 157                                                                             The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
#&gt; 158                                                                                                                               The management is rude.
#&gt; 159                                                                        She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
#&gt; 160                                                "The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."
#&gt; 161                                                                                                                 I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
#&gt; 162                   "We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived."
#&gt; 163                                                                                           Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
#&gt; 164                                                                                    "I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food."
#&gt; 165                                    I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
#&gt; 166                                                                                      "Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked."
#&gt; 167                                                                                                                                  Terrible management.
#&gt; 168                                                                                       "(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold."
#&gt; 169                                                                                                             Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
#&gt; 170                                                                                                           I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
#&gt; 171                                                                                                                                    I was so insulted.
#&gt; 172                                                                                                            It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
#&gt; 173                                                                                                                         Waited and waited and waited.
#&gt; 174                                                                                                                       Food quality has been horrible.
#&gt; 175                                                                                                                                                #NAME?

#&gt; 178                                                                                                                      RUDE &amp; INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.

#&gt; 181                                                                                                                         This was like the final blow!

#&gt; 188                                                                             "No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it."
#&gt; 189                                                                                                                                The food was terrible.
#&gt; 190                                                                                       "For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."
#&gt; 191                                                              The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
#&gt; 192                                         The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
#&gt; 193 "Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil."
#&gt; 194                                                   The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
#&gt; 195                                                                                                       I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
#&gt; 196                                                    "I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!"
#&gt; 197                                                                                                             It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
#&gt; 198                Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
#&gt; 199                                                                                    "This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant."
#&gt; 200                                                                                                                            The manager was the worst.
#&gt; 201                                                                                       The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
#&gt; 202                             "The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace."
#&gt; 203                                                                                              "Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it."
#&gt; 204                                                                    I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
#&gt; 205                                                                                                   "Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold."
#&gt; 206                                                                 "I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
#&gt; 207                                                                                                                   "Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
#&gt; 208                                                                                               There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
#&gt; 209                Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
#&gt; 210                                       The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
#&gt; 211                                                                                                                           We will not be coming back.
#&gt; 212                                                  I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
#&gt; 213                                                                                                "The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way."
#&gt; 214                                                                                                          the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
#&gt; 215                                                                                                                                    Very poor service.
#&gt; 216                                                                "The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
#&gt; 217                                                                       "I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."
#&gt; 218                                                                                                                                    I wouldn't return.
#&gt; 219                                                                                                                       The service was extremely slow.
#&gt; 220                                                                                                                          After two I felt disgusting.
#&gt; 221                                                               The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it purÃ©ed.
#&gt; 222         "Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"
#&gt; 223                                The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
#&gt; 224                                                                                                                           "Will never, ever go back."
#&gt; 225                                                                                                                   My gyro was basically lettuce only.
#&gt; 226                                The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
#&gt; 227                                                                                         I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
#&gt; 228                                               "If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you."
#&gt; 229                                                                                                "Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"
#&gt; 230                                                                                                                                    I was so insulted.
#&gt; 231                                                                                The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
#&gt; 232                                                                                                                              And then tragedy struck.
#&gt; 233                                                                                                                            The warm beer didn't help.
#&gt; 234                                          "I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location."
#&gt; 235                                                                                                            The service was poor and thats being nice.
#&gt; 236                                                                                          "Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
#&gt; 237                                                          "Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee."
#&gt; 238                                    I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
#&gt; 239                "By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known."
#&gt; 240                                                                                                     Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
#&gt; 241                                                                                                                                 It was probably dirt.
#&gt; 242                                                                                                        "The service was terrible, food was mediocre."
#&gt; 243                                                                                       It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
#&gt; 244                                                                                          The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
#&gt; 245                                                                                                                               Food was really boring.
#&gt; 246                          "No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
#&gt; 247                        I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
#&gt; 248                                                                     They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
#&gt; 249                                        The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
#&gt; 250                                                                                                               This place should honestly be blown up.
#&gt; 251                                                                                                      WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
#&gt; 252                                                                                            I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
#&gt; 253                                                                                                                                  Service stinks here!

#&gt; 262                                                                                                                       The ambiance isn't much better.
#&gt; 263                                                                      We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
#&gt; 264                                                                         "too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place."
#&gt; 265                                The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
#&gt; 266                                                                                                                           We will not be coming back.
#&gt; 267                                                                                                             We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
#&gt; 268                                                                                               The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
#&gt; 269                                                 "The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
#&gt; 270                                                                                                            Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
#&gt; 271                                                                                                          first time there and might just be the last.
#&gt; 272                                                                                                                     "Unfortunately, it was not good."
#&gt; 273                                                               walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
#&gt; 274                                           I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
#&gt; 275                                                                                                        "The service was terrible, food was mediocre."
#&gt; 276                                                                    "like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""
#&gt; 277                                                                     There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
#&gt; 278                                                                                                                                   I never come again.
#&gt; 279                                                                                  WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
#&gt; 280                                                                                                                                     Terrible service!
#&gt; 281                                                                       Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
#&gt; 282                              The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
#&gt; 283                                                                                                   I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
#&gt; 284                                                                                                                       I've never been treated so bad.
#&gt; 285                                                                                                  "Needless to say, we will never be back here again."
#&gt; 286                                                                                                    I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
#&gt; 287                                                                                                The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
#&gt; 288                                                                                                                               Weird vibe from owners.
#&gt; 289                                                                                                                                Hell no will I go back
#&gt; 290                                              "If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people."
#&gt; 291                                                                                                   "Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it."
#&gt; 292                                                                                                                      They dropped more than the ball.
#&gt; 293                                                                                                                  Overpriced for what you are getting.
#&gt; 294                                                                                          "Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house."
#&gt; 295                                                                         I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
#&gt; 296                                                                    "like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""

#&gt; 298                                                                                                   I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
#&gt; 299                                                                         I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
#&gt; 300                                                                                                                                  But I don't like it.
#&gt; 301                                                                                                           "What did bother me, was the slow service."
#&gt; 302                "I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."
#&gt; 303                                                                                                                     The RI style calamari was a joke.
#&gt; 304                                                                                                                      The service was terrible though.
#&gt; 305                                                                                                                             Disappointing experience.
#&gt; 306                                                                                                                   My gyro was basically lettuce only.
#&gt; 307                                                     So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
#&gt; 308                                                                              And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
#&gt; 309                                                                                                                                    Very poor service.
#&gt; 310                                                                                                The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
#&gt; 311                                                     "As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return."
#&gt; 312                                                                                                                            The manager was the worst.
#&gt; 313                                                                                                                       The ambiance isn't much better.
#&gt; 314                                                                                            It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
#&gt; 315                                                                                                                                        Service sucks.
#&gt; 316                                                                                               "Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed."
#&gt; 317                                                                                                                     The worst was the salmon sashimi.
#&gt; 318                                                                                                               Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
#&gt; 319                                                                                                                           I've had better atmosphere.
#&gt; 320                                                                                                  Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
#&gt; 321                                                                                         After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
#&gt; 322                                                                                                                                   This is a disgrace.
#&gt; 323                                                                                                                               I give it 2 thumbs down
#&gt; 324                                                                             The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
#&gt; 325                                                                                                                                   This is a disgrace.
#&gt; 326                                                         "The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
#&gt; 327                                                                                                                               I just wanted to leave.
#&gt; 328                                                                                                             I took back my money and got outta there.
#&gt; 329                                                                                                                                      He was terrible!
#&gt; 330                                                                                                                   "Strike 2, who wants to be rushed."
#&gt; 331                                                                                                                Waitress was a little slow in service.
#&gt; 332                                                            "Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
#&gt; 333                                                "The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again."
#&gt; 334                                                                                                                                    I was so insulted.
#&gt; 335                                   We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
#&gt; 336                                                                                                                                    I was so insulted.
#&gt; 337                               Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
#&gt; 338                                                                                                       I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
#&gt; 339                                                                                                       Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
#&gt; 340                                                            "Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table."
#&gt; 341                                                            When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
#&gt; 342                                                              We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
#&gt; 343                                                                                                                                Hell no will I go back
#&gt; 344                                   "I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list."
#&gt; 345               "On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."
#&gt; 346                                                                                                                     I would not recommend this place.
#&gt; 347                    "I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense."
#&gt; 348                                                                         We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
#&gt; 349                                                                                       The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
#&gt; 350                                                 "The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
#&gt; 351                                The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
#&gt; 352                                                                                                                                    I was so insulted.
#&gt; 353                                                                                                            Must have been an off night at this place.
#&gt; 354                                                                                 "Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!"
#&gt; 355                                                                                                "The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way."
#&gt; 356                                                                                                      "Then our food came out, disappointment ensued."
#&gt; 357                                                                                                                 The turkey and roast beef were bland.
#&gt; 358                                                                                                "Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!"
#&gt; 359                                                                                                                     I would not recommend this place.
#&gt; 360                                                                "The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
#&gt; 361                                                                                                                                        Awful service.
#&gt; 362                                                                                           I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
#&gt; 363                                                                                                                                      Nothing special.
#&gt; 364                                                                                                "The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way."
#&gt; 365                                                                 "I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
#&gt; 366                                                                  At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
#&gt; 367                                                                "The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
#&gt; 368                                                                                       "For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed."
#&gt; 369                                                                                                                                   I never come again.
#&gt; 370                                                 "The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
#&gt; 371                                                                                                      WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
#&gt; 372                                                                                                                    My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
#&gt; 373                                                     So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
#&gt; 374                                                                                                                                 It was probably dirt.
#&gt; 375                                                                                                     Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
#&gt; 376                                                                                                                                       It was packed!!
#&gt; 377                                                                                           Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
#&gt; 378                                                                                                                 Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
#&gt; 379                                                                                                        The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
#&gt; 380                                                                                                   I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
#&gt; 381                                                                         I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
#&gt; 382                                                 "The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."
#&gt; 383                                                        Waited 2 hours &amp; never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
#&gt; 384                                                                                                   Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
#&gt; 385                                                                                                                    My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
#&gt; 386                                                                                                                             AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
#&gt; 387                                                                                                                              What a mistake that was!
#&gt; 388                                                                                 "The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless."
#&gt; 389                                                    "Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best."
#&gt; 390                          "No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."
#&gt; 391                                                                          "However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good."
#&gt; 392                                                                                                                         This was like the final blow!
#&gt; 393                                                                                                                                           Over rated.
#&gt; 394                        "On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
#&gt; 395                                                                                                                                I consider this theft.
#&gt; 396                                                                                                       I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
#&gt; 397                                                                                                 "This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas."
#&gt; 398                                                                                       It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
#&gt; 399                                    I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
#&gt; 400                                                                                                              "As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."
#&gt; 401                                                                                                      "It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry."
#&gt; 402                                             It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
#&gt; 403                                                                                                                   I probably would not go here again.
#&gt; 404                                                                                                                 The turkey and roast beef were bland.
#&gt; 405                                                                                                 "If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where."
#&gt; 406                                                                                            Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
#&gt; 407                                                                                                                              And then tragedy struck.
#&gt; 408                                                                                                                                    Crust is not good.
#&gt; 409                                                       "Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings."
#&gt; 410                                                                                                       Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
#&gt; 411                                                                                                My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
#&gt; 412                                                                                                                                        Mediocre food.
#&gt; 413                                                                                                        I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
#&gt; 414                                                                                                          Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
#&gt; 415                                                                                                                 I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
#&gt; 416         "Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"
#&gt; 417                                                                                                            Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
#&gt; 418                                                                                                        If you are reading this please don't go there.
#&gt; 419                        I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
#&gt; 420                                                                          "There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better"
#&gt; 421                                                                                                         And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
#&gt; 422                              "Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables."
#&gt; 423                                                                                                                                        Mediocre food.
#&gt; 424                                                                                                                                 It was probably dirt.
#&gt; 425                 Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
#&gt; 426                                                                                                                                        Service sucks.
#&gt; 427                                                                                                                     The RI style calamari was a joke.
#&gt; 428                        "On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop."
#&gt; 429                                                                                                                                 It was equally awful.
#&gt; 430                                                                                                                                      It was not good.
#&gt; 431                                                     "The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""
#&gt; 432                                                                                                                     I would not recommend this place.
#&gt; 433                                                                                                             "I probably won't be back, to be honest."
#&gt; 434                                                                                                                               Not good for the money.
#&gt; 435                                                                                                                         But then they came back cold.
#&gt; 436                                                                           A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
#&gt; 437                                                                                                                           "Will never, ever go back."
#&gt; 438                                                                                       The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
#&gt; 439                                                                                                   I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
#&gt; 440                                                                                                                                 It was equally awful.
#&gt; 441                                                                 My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
#&gt; 442                                                              The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
#&gt; 443                                                                                                                                 It was probably dirt.
#&gt; 444                 Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
#&gt; 445                                                                                                              "The service was not up to par, either."
#&gt; 446                                                                                                               This place should honestly be blown up.
#&gt; 447                                                                                                                                It was way over fried.
#&gt; 448                                                               walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
#&gt; 449                                                                                                              The live music on Fridays totally blows.
#&gt; 450                                                                                                                                    Avoid at all cost!
#&gt; 451                                                                                                       I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
#&gt; 452  "Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too."
#&gt; 453                               I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
#&gt; 454                                                                                                                  We won't be going back anytime soon!
#&gt; 455                                                                                                                           I've had better atmosphere.
#&gt; 456                "The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor."
#&gt; 457                                    If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
#&gt; 458                                                                                                                             Disappointing experience.
#&gt; 459                                                                                                                                  Con: spotty service.
#&gt; 460                                                                                                   This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
#&gt; 461                                 "seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
#&gt; 462                                                                                                Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.
#&gt; 463                                                                                                                                      He was terrible!
#&gt; 464                                                                             Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
#&gt; 465                                                                                                                  This one is simply a disappointment.
#&gt; 466                                                                                       I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.

#&gt; 477                                                                                                      I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!

#&gt; 555                            "Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good."

#&gt; 563               Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
#&gt; 564                                                                                                  "You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care."

#&gt; 569                                                                           One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .

#&gt; 742                                                                              The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
#&gt; 743                                                                          This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
#&gt; 744                                                                           "I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"
#&gt; 745                                                                                                                              Pretty cool I would say.
#&gt; 746                                                                                                          "All in all, I can assure you I'll be back."
#&gt; 747                                                                                                           The crÃªpe was delicate and thin and moist.
#&gt; 748                                                                                                                    Their steaks are 100% recommended!
#&gt; 749                                                                                                                                      Extremely Tasty!
#&gt; 750                                                                                        Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.
#&gt; 751                                                                                                               "Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!"
#&gt; 752                                                     Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
#&gt; 753                                      "Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo."
#&gt; 754                                                                                                                                   Very very fun chef.
#&gt; 755                                                                                                  They really want to make your experience a good one.
#&gt; 756                                                                                                                           Those burgers were amazing.
#&gt; 757                                                                                                                                  He deserves 5 stars.
#&gt; 758                          I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.
#&gt; 759                                                                                                                               Reasonably priced also!
#&gt; 760                                                                                                                                Go To Place for Gyros.
#&gt; 761                                                                                                                                           I LOVED it!
#&gt; 762                                                                                                          The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
#&gt; 763                                                                                                    "For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go."
#&gt; 764                                                                                                        I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
#&gt; 765                                                                                                               All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
#&gt; 766                                                                                          OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.
#&gt; 767                                                               This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
#&gt; 768                                                                                                                     This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#&gt; 769                                                                                                                       And service was super friendly.
#&gt; 770                                                                                                               "I had strawberry tea, which was good."
#&gt; 771                                                                                                     The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.
#&gt; 772                                                                                                                                 Pretty awesome place.
#&gt; 773                                                                                                                     Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.
#&gt; 774                                                                         I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.
#&gt; 775                                                                                                    I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
#&gt; 776                                                                                                  "You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care."
#&gt; 777                                                                                                                            "Plus, it's only 8 bucks."
#&gt; 778                                                                                        Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
#&gt; 779                                                 Four stars for the food &amp; the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe &amp; still letting us in to eat !
#&gt; 780                                                                                                        What I really like there is the crepe station.
#&gt; 781                                                                                                                        "I'm so happy to be here!!!"""
#&gt; 782                                                                              "Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree."
#&gt; 783                                                               When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
#&gt; 784                                                    The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
#&gt; 785                                   Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
#&gt; 786                                                                                                                                Service was fantastic.
#&gt; 787                                                                                                                      Seriously killer hot chai latte.
#&gt; 788                                                                                                       The staff are also very friendly and efficient.
#&gt; 789                                                                           The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.
#&gt; 790                                                                                                                     The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
#&gt; 791                                                                                       "A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal."
#&gt; 792                                                                                                                                 Pretty awesome place.
#&gt; 793                                                                                  The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
#&gt; 794                                                                                                                 Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
#&gt; 795                                                                                                                   They have a really nice atmosphere.
#&gt; 796                                                                                                                                 This is a good joint.
#&gt; 797                                                                                                                             Waitress was good though!
#&gt; 798                                                                                                                                           Both great!
#&gt; 799                                                                                                                     What a great double cheeseburger!
#&gt; 800                                                                                         "That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased."
#&gt; 801                                                                                                                            "Plus, it's only 8 bucks."
#&gt; 802                                                                                          I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
#&gt; 803                                                                                                                  I did not expect this to be so good!
#&gt; 804                                                                   "Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while."

#&gt; 818                                           They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.
#&gt; 819                                                                                                       Food was really good and I got full petty fast.

#&gt; 827                                            "I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from."

#&gt; 855                                  They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.

#&gt; 877                                                                                                                                    I love this place.
#&gt; 878                                                                                                       It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
#&gt; 879                                                                                                                       Pretty good beer selection too.
#&gt; 880                                                                                                                     Best tater tots in the southwest.
#&gt; 881                                                                                         These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
#&gt; 882                                                                                                                     The food came out at a good pace.
#&gt; 883                                                                                                                      I hope this place sticks around.
#&gt; 884                                                                                                       (The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
#&gt; 885                                               "Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways."
#&gt; 886                                                                                         "That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased."
#&gt; 887                                                                                                     The price is reasonable and the service is great.
#&gt; 888                                         "Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for."
#&gt; 889                                                                                           "Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative."
#&gt; 890                                                                       "In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful."
#&gt; 891                                                                                                                                       It was awesome.
#&gt; 892                                                                                                                They were golden-crispy and delicious.
#&gt; 893                                                                                                                      If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
#&gt; 894                                                                                                        What I really like there is the crepe station.
#&gt; 895                                                                                                                                       Fantastic food!
#&gt; 896                                                                             We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
#&gt; 897                                                                                                                           Best tacos in town by far!!
#&gt; 898                                                                                                                   The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
#&gt; 899                                                                                                                              So absolutley fantastic.
